# ng2-bootstrap â€” starter template for Angular 2 apps

This project is a starter template for a typical [Angular 2](http://angularjs.org/) web app.



## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the ng2-bootstrap repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the ng2-bootstrap repository. You can get git from
[http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/).

We also use a number of npm to initialize ng2-bootstrap. You must have node.js and
its package manager (npm) installed.  You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).

### Clone ng2-bootstrap

Clone the ng2-bootstrap repository using [git][git]:

```
git clone git@github.com:populationtwo/ng2-bootstrap.git
cd ng2-bootstrap
```

### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and angular framework code.  The tools help
us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].

```
npm install
```

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:3000/`.
